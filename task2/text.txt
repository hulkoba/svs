In addition to being a cat, it also contains this text.

By manipulating the image data and the text data at the bit level, we can tweak the image to include information that is imperceptible to the human eye.

Color data in BMP files is stored as RGB values where one byte is allocated for each of red, blue, and green. Each of these values can be changed by a small amount without changing the appearance of the image. To determine what amount to change the bytes by, we use the binary data of the text file.

As an example, let’s see how we would embed the letter “D” into a solid block of orange. The letter “D” has the ASCII hex value 44 and binary value 01000100. The shade of orange I chose has the hex value FF 7F 27 which has the binary value 11111111 01111111 00100111. I mentioned before that we can alter these RGB numbers slightly. The specific method I chose was to set the last bit of each RGB byte to 1 or 0 based on the corresponding bit in the text data. This chart shows how each bit of the “D” is stored across three orange pixels (for a total of 9 bytes–one of which is not used).

The orange in the “result” column really is changed. I used the new hex values, but as you can see it looks exactly the same as the “template” column.
